# Algorithm Projects in Rust

Algorithm projects in Rust is a serie of training set, exploring algorithm implementation using Rust programming language.
The planned targets to complete with this bootcamp session:

* Rust language training, applying it to some algorithm technique implementation.
* Algorithm review. Refresh important algorithm topics and resolution techniques.
* Improve algorithm implementation skills.
